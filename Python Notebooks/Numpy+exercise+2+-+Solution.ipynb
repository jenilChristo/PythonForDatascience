This notebook will walk you through normalising the data and then dividing the data set into smaller subsets. It is recommended that while attempting each of the tasks visit the NumPy library to find the most appropriate function which can help you achieve the desired result. More often than not you will find the functions which you require prewritten in the library. The **numpy library** can be found [here.](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) \n","\n","Without further ado, the first task is to mean normalise a data set. Mean normalising is a data transformation done to reduce the variations in the data set. For example, consider a data set which has integers between 0 and 10000. That is a lot of variation, and it becomes difficult to build ML algorithms on this data. So mean normalisation is done on such data, after the transformation, the mean of the data will be zero, and standard deviation will be 1.  Even though the actual values of data will change a lot, but the overall variation is still kept intact. If the concept of normalisation feels a bit unclear dont worry all of this will be covered in the future sections of this program. For now, let’s concentrate on the tasks at hand. \n","\n","\n","# Task 1: Mean Normalisation: \n","\n","**Question 1.1** Create a 2D of random integers between 0 and 10,000 (including both 0 and 10,000) with 25000 rows and 15 columns.
